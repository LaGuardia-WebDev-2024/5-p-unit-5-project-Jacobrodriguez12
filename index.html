      <h1>Samba Wales Bonner- Black Pony Hair</h1> 
      
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
<p>
  <spam class="first">The first Item is called the Wales Bonner Pony Hair Sambas.</spam> I asked for these because they would match with so many of my very cute outfits. I would also like these shoes because these are a type of shoe that I can wear with almost everything. I dont know if I will get them because they are very very VERY expensive but it is worth a try😄.

<p>
  <span class="first">The next item on my christmas list is a Macbook Pro.</span> I asked for this item because the current camera on my computer does nto work. I went to go get it fixed, they fixed it and then it broke again whihc really had me so angry. I also just need a new one for college because my current computer is 6 years old. This is one of my main gifts😊.

<p>
  <span class="first">This last item is a Ralph Lauren Sweater.</span> I think that this sweater is one of the cutest things that I have ever seen. This item is not a big must but I would really love to have it. I feel like this item would really give me a whole updated wardrobe I would be able to make such cute outfits with all these new cloths that I asked for🤪!
